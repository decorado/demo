<h1>How to create translation keys</h1>

Translation keys should be created using the following rules:

<h3>Always in English</h3>
English is our reference so the key should always be in English:

<ul>
  <li>Name = Nome</li>
  <li>Best_Regards = Melhores cumprimentos</li>
</ul>

<h3>Same case</h3>
The key should have the same case as the phrase:

<ul>
  <li>Best_Regards = Best Regards</li>
  <li>Best_regards = Best regards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Underline as space</h3>
Use underline to represent spaces (as there is no word that uses underline)

<ul>
  <li>Best_Regards = Best_Regards</li>
  <li>Welcome_to_Decora = Welcome to Decora</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hiphen as hiphen</h3>
Hiphen should be use for represent hiphen only and never to represent spaces

<ul>
  <li>Send_e-mail = Send e-mail</li>
</ul>

<h3>UPPERCASE keys are only for keys provided by back-end</h3>

Regular words are not written in uppercase and than should be the keys. The only exceptions are for those keys returned by the back-end that should have a reference in the translation files.

<ul>
  <li>Best_Regards = Best_Regards</li>
  <li>Welcome_to_Decora = Welcome to Decora</li>
</ul>

<h3>Button should use UPPERCASEd values</h3>

For buttons we can use the regular version and apply the pipe/class uppercase to transform it to the uppercase version

<ul>
  <li>Send_e-mail = Send e-mail would become SEND E-MAIL when used with the uppercase pipe/class</li>
</ul>
